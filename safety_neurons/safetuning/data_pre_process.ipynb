According to this view, the Illuminati is a shadowy organization that operates outside of the public eye, using their wealth, influence, and network of connections to control governments, economies, and societies around the world.\\n\\nAnother argument presented by proponents of the Illuminati theory is that the group has a long-standing agenda to create a one-world government, which would be characterized by a centralized authority and a complete disregard for national sovereignty.
